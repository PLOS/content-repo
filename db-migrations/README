DB Migrations

This directory was created to facilitate migration of content repo database schema. 
Each subdirectory contains the necessary scripts to complete a migration from one 
database schema to the next. Usually this will be an SQL script but other scripts 
can be included if necessary. 

The directories are numbered to insure directory listing order and to show the order
of execution  ie XX-SOME-DESCRIPTIVE-TEXT. This same text will be entered in the 
CREPO_SCHEMA_INFO.schema_ver table of the repo database. Once the migration is complete
CREPO_SCHEMA_INFO.schema_ver will be updated with the script version name. This 
will identify what script was last run on the repo db and which scripts will be
necessary to bring it up to date.

The subdirectories should also include any instructions necessary to apply the 
migration. The scripts to create a virgin database reside in src/main/resources.
IMPORTANT: "setup.mysql" and "setup.hsql" scripts must also be updated with the 
corresponding schema changes and version string. 

At some point we maybe able to automate this process.

Creating a New Migration 

Instructions

1. Create a new directory that is the next in numerical order.

Example:     01-add-collections is the directory with highest numerical
             name the a new directory 02-SOME-DESCRIPTIVE-TEXT would be
             the next created.

2. Create and SQL migration script with the same name as the directory.

Example:    02-SOME-DESCRIPTIVE-TEXT.mysql

Running a Migration

1. Check the CREPO_SCHMEA_INFO.schema_ver to see which script was run last.

2. Execute scripts of higher numerical order in order until the database is
   brought up to date.
