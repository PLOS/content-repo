1.1.1 (7/21/2014)
* Fixed bucket creation bug when using a MogileFS backend.
* Fixed If-Modified-Since time comparison behavior.
* Fixed XML rendering of /status endpoint.

1.1.0 (7/10/2014)
* Refactored error handler to return repo specific error codes in message body instead of relying only on HTTP codes and free text.
* Added /objects/meta/ as a new endpoint so /objects/?fetchmetadata=true can be depricated.
* Make file system optionally reproxyable. A static file server can now be used to serve assets off the file system store. This way reproxying can be used/tested without MogileFS.

1.0.0 (7/7/2014)
* Initial release
